1.

Title: Stored XSS in comments section

Severity: High

Vulnerability Description: Found a stored XSS vulnerability on the blog's comments section. The input is not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts that execute for any user viewing the page.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Navigate to blog post: https://www.google.com/search?q=https://example.com/blog/post-123

2. Submit a comment with the payload: <script>alert('XSS')</script>

3. The script is stored in the database.

4. Any user who views the comment section will have the script executed in their browser.


Impact: An attacker can steal user cookies, session tokens, and perform actions on behalf of the user.



Title: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

Severity: Medium

Vulnerability Description: Discovered an IDOR in the document viewing feature. By changing the document ID in the URL, an attacker can access documents belonging to other users.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Log in as user A.

2. View a document and note the URL: https://www.google.com/search?q=https://example.com/docs%3Fid%3D123

3. Change the 'id' parameter to '124'.

4. Document '124' is displayed, which belongs to user B.


Impact: Unauthorized access to private user data, leading to a privacy breach.



Title: SQL Injection in search bar

Severity: Critical

Vulnerability Description: The search bar is vulnerable to SQL injection. An attacker can use a payload to bypass authentication and gain access to the database.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Go to the search bar.

2. Enter the payload: ' OR 1=1 --

3. The search results show all data from the database, not just the filtered results.


Impact: Complete database compromise, including sensitive user data.



Title: Unrestricted File Upload

Severity: High

Vulnerability Description: The user profile picture upload functionality does not validate file extensions, allowing for a malicious script to be uploaded.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Upload a file named shell.php with PHP code that provides a shell.

2. The server accepts and stores the file.

3. An attacker can access the file via its URL to execute commands on the server.


Impact: Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server, leading to a full system compromise.



Title: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

Severity: Critical

Vulnerability Description: The website has a feature to import images from a URL. This feature does not validate the URL, which can be exploited for SSRF.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Navigate to the image import page.

2. Provide the internal IP address of the server, e.g., http://127.0.0.1.

3. The server makes a request to itself, and a successful connection is returned.


Impact: An attacker can scan internal network ports and potentially access sensitive internal services.



Title: Command Injection in system logs feature

Severity: High

Vulnerability Description: Command injection vulnerability in the system logs viewing feature. The application does not sanitize user input before passing it to a shell command.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Go to the log search feature.

2. Enter the payload: ; ls -la;

3. The server executes the ls -la command and returns the output in the response.


Impact: Remote command execution, allowing the attacker to explore the file system and potentially gain a reverse shell.



Title: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in URL parameters

Severity: Low

Vulnerability Description: Reflected XSS was found in the URL. A user can be tricked into clicking a malicious URL, which executes a script on the page.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Visit https://example.com/page?param=<script>alert(1)</script>.

2. An alert box appears on the page.


Impact: Session hijacking, defacement, and phishing attacks.



Title: Missing Rate Limiting on Login Form

Severity: Medium

Vulnerability Description: The login form does not have rate limiting, allowing an attacker to perform an unlimited number of login attempts.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Use a tool to send a large number of POST requests to the login form with various passwords.

2. The server does not block or slow down the requests after multiple failed attempts.


Impact: Brute-force attacks to guess user passwords, leading to account takeover.



Title: Broken Authentication due to weak password reset logic

Severity: High

Vulnerability Description: A flaw in the password reset function allows an attacker to reset a user's password without the user's consent.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Go to the password reset page and request a reset for a target user.

2. Intercept the request and notice the reset token is a simple, guessable 4-digit number.

3. Brute-force the token from 0000 to 9999.

4. The attacker successfully resets the password.


Impact: Account takeover.



Title: Sensitive data exposure in JavaScript file

Severity: Medium

Vulnerability Description: A sensitive API key is hard-coded and exposed in a public JavaScript file.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Go to the website and open the developer tools.

2. Go to the sources tab and find a JavaScript file.

3. Search for "API\_KEY" or similar keywords.

4. The key is found in plain text.


Impact: The attacker can use the key to access the API and its functions, potentially leading to data leakage or other attacks.
